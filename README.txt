Simple 'Tap to Jump' HTML5 game â€” mobile-friendly.

How to play:
- Open index.html in a mobile browser (Chrome recommended).
- Tap the screen to jump; hold to jump slightly higher.
- Avoid obstacles. Score increases as you pass obstacles.

How to publish:
- Upload the ZIP to itch.io, Game Jolt or GDevelop.io.
- For Play Store: you'll need to wrap into an Android WebView APK/AAB or export from a game engine (ask me to help).

If you want edits (new graphics, sounds, ads hookup, or an APK), tell me what to change.
